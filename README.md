# ⏳ Fading Days

**Fading Days** is a minimalist browser extension for **Chrome** and **Firefox** that makes you aware of the passage of time by counting down to key moments in your life — retirement, milestones, or any date that matters to you.

It calculates not just the remaining days, but also the number of **weekends**, **Christmas Eves**, **Easter Sundays**, **summer vacations**, **public holidays**, **working days**, and **days off** left until your target date.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Multiple countdown targets** — Set a primary goal (e.g., retirement) and additional targets (e.g., mortgage payoff, 40th birthday). Switch between them with navigation arrows.
- **Rich metrics** — For each target, see:
  - Total remaining days
  - Remaining weekends (full Saturday + Sunday pairs)
  - Remaining Christmas Eves (December 24)
  - Remaining Easter Sundays (computed via the Gauss algorithm)
  - Remaining summer vacations (July 1)
  - Remaining public holidays (fetched from [Nager.Date API](https://date.nager.at/))
  - Remaining working days (excludes weekends and public holidays)
  - Remaining days off (weekends + public holidays on weekdays)
- **Public holidays via Nager.Date API** — The extension uses the free [Nager.Date API](https://date.nager.at/) to fetch public holidays for your country. Holiday data is cached locally for 30 days to minimize network requests. Your country is auto-detected from the browser locale, but can be changed manually in settings. Over 100 countries are supported.
- **Life progress bar** — Enter your date of birth and statistical life expectancy to see a fading progress bar showing how much of your life has statistically already passed.
- **Cloud sync** — All settings are stored via `chrome.storage.sync`, so your data follows you across devices logged into the same browser account.
- **Multi-language support** — Available in 7 languages:
  - 🇬🇧 English
  - 🇵🇱 Polski (Polish)
  - 🇩🇪 Deutsch (German)
  - 🇪🇸 Español (Spanish)
  - 🇫🇷 Français (French)
  - 🇰🇷 한국어 (Korean)
  - 🇨🇳 中文 (Chinese)

  Language can be changed at any time in the extension's settings page. The extension name and description are also translated natively via Chrome's `_locales` system for better discoverability in Chrome Web Store.
- **Configurable metrics** — Choose which countdowns to display in the popup. Toggle weekends, Christmas Eves, Easters, vacations, public holidays, working days, and days off on or off independently.
- **Default target** — Set any target as the default one shown when the popup opens, not just the first in the list.
- **Two target modes** — Define each target by a specific **date** or by **age** (e.g., retirement at 65). In age mode, the target date is automatically calculated from your date of birth.
- **Dark, minimal design** — A somber, thoughtful aesthetic with a deep dark background, muted copper accent color, monospace number fonts, and smooth fade-in animations.

## 📸 UI Overview

### Popup (main window)
When you click the extension icon, you see:
1. **Header** — Current target name with navigation arrows (if multiple targets exist).
2. **Main counter** — Large, prominent number of remaining days in accent color.
3. **Life progress bar** — Subtle fading bar (visible only if birth date and life expectancy are set).
4. **Metrics grid** — Dynamic grid showing only the enabled metrics (weekends, Christmas Eves, Easters, vacations).
5. **Settings button** — Gear icon in the footer leading to the options page.

### Options page
A full-page settings interface where you can:
- Select your preferred **language** (7 languages available).
- Enter your **date of birth** (optional, used for age-based targets and the life progress bar).
- Set your **statistical life expectancy** (optional, enables the life progress bar).
- Toggle **visible metrics** — choose which countdowns (weekends, Christmas Eves, Easters, vacations, public holidays, working days, days off) appear in the popup.
- Select your **country** — auto-detected from the browser or set manually. Used to fetch public holidays from the Nager.Date API.
- Manage **target dates** — add, edit, rename, or delete countdown targets. Each target can use **date mode** (specific date) or **age mode** (target age, calculated from birth date).
- **Set any target as default** — the default target is shown when the popup opens.
- Links to **GitHub** repository and **Buy Me a Coffee** in the footer.

### Key Algorithms

- **Easter date calculation** — Uses the [Gauss Easter algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_of_Easter#Anonymous_Gregorian_algorithm) to compute the movable date of Easter Sunday for any given year.
- **Weekend counting** — Iterates from the current date, advancing to the nearest Saturday, then counts complete Saturday–Sunday pairs until the target date.
- **Christmas Eve / Vacation counting** — Simple year-by-year iteration checking if December 24 or July 1 falls within the remaining date range.
- **Public holidays** — Fetched per year from the [Nager.Date API](https://date.nager.at/api/v3/PublicHolidays/{year}/{countryCode}) and cached in `chrome.storage.local` for 30 days. Only years within the date range are fetched, and requests are parallelized. Country is auto-detected from `navigator.language` or set manually.
- **Working days / Days off** — Computed by iterating day-by-day through the range, classifying each as weekend, weekday holiday, or working day.
